Basic instructions:

Utilized IntelliJ to supply executable .jar file. Once the repository has 
been downloaded, pulled, cloned or magically delievered via Fairies simply
double click (albeit I assume you've figured that much out).

Once you launch the program and admire all of the hardwork put into it's
masterful design techniques, it's time to choose your directory. And 
this is the weakest point of the design, as it requires the DIR to 
contain both "train" and "test" -- however if not choosen that has 
been error checked. Also of note is the fact that you can't edit these
textfields (you know who you are). This is done via "Choose Dir..." button
and the rest will be taken care of for you.

If you want to test larger datasets (given that the new Dir  contains
both train and test) or you simply want to admire the background once again
just click the button convieniently labelled "Clear Data". 

If I had to guess, the larger the dataset the lower the accuracy and perhaps the higher 
the precision. It's hard to tell if I implemented the algorithm correctly at times
just given the sheer numbers of 0.0 and 1.0 -- albeit I realize the 0.0 is merely
due to the decimal limitations. 

TL;DR:

1. Pull repos
2. DClick jar
3. Choose dir using "Choose Dir..."
4. Clear data using "Clear Data"
5. Get out of this boring program

Also, according to my trials, the accuracy and precision both fall after running
the version pulled from github.  Very strange.
